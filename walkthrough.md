# Walkthrough: Genesis Bootstrap V2 Analysis (Session 2026-01-18)

## 🎯 Goal
Deep dive into the "Three Hidden Risks" of the Genesis Bootstrap (Appx D) and evolve it to handle "Mega Recursion" (10-layer depth) and "Professional IDE Workflows".

## 🏗️ Changes & Achievements

### 1. The Genesis V2 Upgrade (3 Agents + 8 Skills)
We expanded the core definition in `Agentic_Dev_Playbook_2026.md` from 4 to 8 Seed Skills to match professional IDE capabilities.

| New Skill | Replaces Human Tool | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`skill_impact_analysis`** | VS Code "Find Ref" / GoTo Def | **Tech Lead** (Pre-flight check) |
| **`skill_db_inspector`** | DataGrip / TablePlus | **Architect** (Data-First Design) |
| **`skill_api_tester`** | Postman / Thunder Client | **Tech Lead** (Mock/Test) |
| **`skill_visual_snapshot`** | Chrome DevTools / Storybook | **Builder** (Visual Proof) |

### 2. Protocol Evolution
*   **Protocol 11.5 (Context Inheritance)**: Solved "Context Amnesia" by forcing Child Tasks to link back to Parent Artifacts (Schema/Spec).
*   **Protocol 12.0 (The Horizon Event)**: Solved "Recursion Paralysis".
    *   **Rule**: If Depth > 4, stop recursion.
    *   **Action**: Create Mock Interface -> Fork new Sub-Session (Project).

### 3. Analysis Artifacts Generated
We created a comprehensive knowledge base in `rules/analysis/`:
*   `genesis_risk_mechanics.md`: Analysis of Fragmentation & Chinese Whispers.
*   `scenario_deep_recursion.md`: Analysis of "Toothpaste Effect".
*   `simulation_strict_recursion.md`: Replay of Strict Mode.
*   `simulation_mega_recursion.md`: Replay of 10-Layer Failure & Fix.
*   `ide_professional_use_cases.md`: Survey of 2025 Engineering Tools.
*   `responsibility_boundary_matrix.md`: Definition of "Where Agents Stop".
*   `invisible_bombs.md`: Mock Drift, Zombie Projects, Ivory Tower.
*   `logic_assessment_genesis_v2.md`: Final Dialectical Audit.

## 🧪 Verification Results
*   **Logic Check**: Passed. The tension between "Data First" and "Mock First" was resolved via "Time-Space Decoupling".
*   **Risk Check**: "Mock Drift" and "Zombie Projects" identified as new risks, mitigated by "Contract Locking" and "Heartbeats".

## 🧘 Post-Mortem (Self-Correction)

### 1. Process Retro
*   **What went well**: The "Simulation" approach (running imaginary scenarios) effectively exposed hidden flaws (like the L10 File Permission causing L1 Latency issues) before we wrote any code.
*   **What was slow**: Manually mapping IDE tools to Skills took time, but was necessary to prove the "Gap".

### 2. Rule Validity
*   **Protocol 11.5** is critical. Without it, the "Builder" is effectively blind in deep recursion.
*   **Appendix D** is now much more robust with 8 Skills.

### 3. Learning
*   **The "Horizon Event"**: We learned that infinite recursion is an anti-pattern. There is a "Cognitive Event Horizon" at Depth 4 where a Monolith *must* become a Federation.
